# 📜 A Trait Contract

Collections (of NFTs) often are associated with a set/combination of traits pulled from a pool of traits. This soroban contract aims at allowing to store the initial pool of traits and then generating a random combination of trait-options from the remaining pool until all traits / options have been drawn from the pool.

## 🙏 Thank you!
